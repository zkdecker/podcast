          <description>Let&apos;s continue building that solid foundation. Take a matter a fact approach and let&apos;s inspect…&#128071;<![CDATA[ <BR><BR> ]]>What didn&apos;t work? Aka what are the lessons you don&apos;t want to repeat? What led you to not hitting your goals...what were the things that you were doing/thinking that led you to NOT hit the goals you had?<![CDATA[ <BR><BR> ]]>Example: when I drink alcohol, I don&apos;t feel my best; when I don&apos;t meditate in the morning much mind is all over the place for the rest of the day; people pleasing and not giving myself what I need; not doing any self care &#128134;; giving my energy to people that never give back to me; beating myself up for everything...<![CDATA[ <BR><BR> ]]>&#128227; Share the 5 biggest lessons from this part with us inside of our Telegram chat &#128172;<![CDATA[ <BR><BR> ]]>IF some emotions come up, LET THEM, lean into them, feel them...(we will process them later too!)<![CDATA[ <BR><BR> ]]>&#127775; BONUS audio: “this shouldn&apos;t have happened”<![CDATA[ <BR><BR> ]]>&#127775; EXERCISE: grab a toilet paper + pen and write your little heart out in a forgiveness letter UNTIL you feel a release, after you are done, go pee on it and flush it! &#129531; (do NOT wipe with it!)<![CDATA[ <BR><BR> ]]>&#127775; Alternative: write it on paper and burn it (safely!) or rip it apart!<![CDATA[ <BR><BR> ]]>After all of this, look back at the lessons you extracted from this part and check in how you feel, are there any emotions still coming up? If so, repeat one of these processes to release more!</description>

          <description>Make sure you count out loud (not just in your mind) from 1 to 10, 2 to 10, 3 to 10...WHILE you are listening to the audio script. You will NOT know consciously what I&apos;m saying but your subconscious mind is ALWAYS listening, and in this case also re-programming.<![CDATA[ <BR><BR> ]]>At the end make sure to take a deep breath and think the word “release” as you exhale. Repeat this breath twice.<![CDATA[ <BR><BR> ]]>If you feel any emotions lingering, repeat the whole exercise one more time.</description>
